Difference between HTTP1 and Http2

* HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
* There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources
* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
* It compresses data by itself.	


*  HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.
*  It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
*  It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
*  It uses HPACK for data compression.


object and its internal representation in javascript:

* Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
* These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
* Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

All JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value.

* One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below
Example:
let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
we have a object.create() , and constructor methods in objet.
